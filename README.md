This web application is designed to help users verify the halal status of food ingredients. It categorizes ingredients into Halal, Haram, or Syubhah. The platform also includes functionality to locate nearby halal restaurants and shops using Google Maps API. The back-end was developed using JSP and managed with SQL Workbench, while the front-end utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive user experience. This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development and my ability to integrate external APIs and database management.
